# Overview

Deferred messages refer to messages that are not immediately processed when available but are rather set to only process at a given future date.

In this guide we'll create the following projects:

- a **Console Application** called `Shuttle.Deferred.Client`
- a **Class Library** called `Shuttle.Deferred.Server`
- and another **Class Library** called `Shuttle.Deferred.Messages` that will contain all our message classes
