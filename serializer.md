# ISerializer

The `shuttle-esb-core` package makes use of the `shuttle-core-infrastructure` package's `ISerializer` interface for serializing any objects.

For more information you can [visit the relevant documentation page](http://shuttle.github.io/shuttle-core/overview-serializer/).

*Please note*: it is recommended that you have a look at the duplicate class name caveat described in above documentation so please remember to explicitly specify you message types.
